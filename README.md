## ABOUT
   Hi I'm Titiksha Lohe. I have a technical background and hold a Masters degree in Finance. 
   I have had a professional career of 5 years in different roles. I am a fresher in the data field, with a strong passion for data.

   I have acquired certification in Data Science from IITM and Intellipaat (2022 - 2023).
